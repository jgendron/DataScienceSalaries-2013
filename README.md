DataScienceSalaries-2013
========================

Use of ShinyApps and an online data set to provide an interactive tool to investigate
salaries for data scientists around the world.

Most interesting for me during this project was working to get ggplot to work with the new
version of Rstudio's ShinyApps. It was challenging - but worth the effort.

Enjoy,
